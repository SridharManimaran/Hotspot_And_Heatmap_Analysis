# London_Traffic_2021
The Hotspot and Heatmap analysis for London traffic 2021 dataset using Arcgis pro software.

Hotspot Analysis

In this personal project focused on hotspot analysis in England, UK, various geospatial techniques were employed to analyze traffic data sourced from the UK Government's official website (https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/regions/6). The project involved converting CSV data to a point feature class using an XY Table to Points tool, followed by projecting the feature class to the British National Grid (27700) for consistency. Further analysis was conducted on the traffic attributes of London Major Roads in 2021 using both 'select by attribute' and 'definition query' methods to extract relevant information. A custom hotspot analysis tool was developed to pinpoint locations of high traffic congestion within the city, offering valuable insights for traffic management strategies.

Heatmap Analysis

To visualize traffic density across London boroughs, Empirical Bayesian Kriging was utilized in this personal project. The traffic data obtained from the UK Government's official website was processed and analyzed to create a heatmap depicting variations in traffic volume. By leveraging Empirical Bayesian Kriging, the analysis accounted for spatial dependencies and provided a more accurate representation of traffic distribution across the city. This heatmap analysis offers valuable insights for urban planning and transportation management, aiding in the development of strategies to alleviate traffic congestion and improve overall traffic flow in London.
